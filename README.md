# Deep Neural Networks from Scratch in Go
Building a simple feedforwad neural network and a convolution neural network from scratch with Go.

### Datasets:
Iris & MNIST

### Workflow:
0. Statically typed, figure out variables and data structures first.
1. Use the same matrix operations in the Python Version of this
2. Rebuild networks using basic matrices
3. Optimize matrix multiplication with distributed matrix multiplcation (~~Divide & Conquer Strassen Matrix Multiplication~~ Cannon's algorithm)
